# Read 01 – Learning Markdown

Skills for Sandbox Learning: <br>
•	Generating and selecting ideas: 
- You have to figure out what do you want to learn now
- You also have to figure out what are you trying to learn now
   - By identifying the minimum viable tasks, you can put on your plate, you don’t overload yourself and can add more tasks on later. <br>
•	Planning your learning: 
- Managing the scope of what you’re learning is a good way to plan for your immediate learning needs
 - Finding resources that will help you complete your tasks and achieve your goals can set you up for success
•	Experimentation: 
- Keep track of what you've tried to do, what has worked that you’ve tried, and what hasn’t worked
 - Doing this will help ensure you’re not doing the same incorrect work over and over again, but will also show you what has worked and can potentially be applied to other tasks
•	Reflection: 
- Pausing every so often to take the time to see what you have learned thus far can bring a great sense of accomplishment and pride. 
- Pausing can also allow you time to think about any new questions you may have regarding what you’ve done
•	Finding help
- There’s nothing shameful about finding help with the various resources available to you.
 - The only dumb question is the one not asked
 
What is Mindset? <br>
•	Mindset: 
- It is the self-perception people have about themselves. Essentially, it’s the way you feel about yourself and your abilities.
•	Fixed mindset: 
- It means believing that basic qualities such as intelligence or talent are fixed traits. 
- It also means that believing that talent alone creates success without effort.
•	Growth mindset: 
- It means believing that people's basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
 
Why Markdown? <br>
•	Markdown is lightweight markup language for generating HTML files.
•	It is not a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor like MS Word or Google Docs. When you write in Markdown, you're not seeing the end product.
•	It uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page

How do we Markdown (md)? <br>
•	GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:
  - Top level README.md files are auto-rendered
  - Any other .md files
  - Issues, comments, code reviews, etc… <br>
•	GitHub Pages will convert your Markdown, apply a theme, and publish it!
